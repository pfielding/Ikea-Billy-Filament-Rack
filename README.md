# Ikea Billy Filament Rack
 A screwless adapter to store filament on Billy bookcases

A simple adapter for Billy Bookcases to allow you to use 3/4" dowel to rack out your filament spools in an easy to grab fashion. I initially tried with 1/2" dowel but found it wasn't sturdy enough for the weight of the filament.

Designed to be printed without supports,  just lay the parts flat on their backs and print.
